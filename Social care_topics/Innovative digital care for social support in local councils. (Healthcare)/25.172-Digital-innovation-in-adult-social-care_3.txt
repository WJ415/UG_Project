 As part of the national offer of support to the
 social care sector, NHSX partnered with Facebook
 to provide over 2,000 portal devices (tablets) to
 help those in social care settings connect with

 A number of areas have been involved in
 piloting the devices in care homes, including
 North Yorkshire County Council, Staffordshire
 County Council and Stoke on Trent Council. In
 North Yorkshire, use of the portals is part of
 a suite of support offered to council-run care
 homes across the county.

 In collaboration with services managers, care
 workers and with feedback from families, a
 package of support (including three different
 video calling solutions) were provided to each
 of the ten care homes. Feedback has been
 positive, for example, in one care home the use
 of video calling enabled residents and families
 to celebrate VE day. Most people preferred
 devices which are portable as they are easier
 for staff to move around the care home and
 hence better supports private calls in a person’s
 room rather than public spaces.

Collaboration between councils
We are also seeing more collaborative
approaches to innovation being taken between
and across councils. For example, in the East of
England, all 11 councils with responsibility for
adult social care have committed to adopting
the same platform to collect and share data
and intelligence to support a high quality and
sustainable market – based on principle of
‘doing once and not 11 times’.

The region named the system they developed
PAMMS (Provider Assessment and Market
Management Solution) which brings together
care quality and financial data from over 2,000
contracted suppliers and 20,000 people to
enable comprehensive care market overview.

Providers are also benefitting from the approach
with improved CQC ratings, peer benchmarking,
a reduced need for multi-agency assessments
and evidenced service improvements.

Additional modules can be added as required
which helps sustainability and scalability.

In supporting the region during COVID-19, the
system has been used to broadcast specific
‘online’ questions directly to providers around their
response management. The region is now looking
at how it can be used to help support recovery.

The collaborative approach has also been
enabled by each council’s commitment to co-
fund dedicated resource which is co-ordinating
intelligence collation and also helping to
strengthen local relationships between councils
and provider partners.

Capital savings of £550,000 have been
delivered to date with further estimated ongoing
annual savings of over £550,000. The approach
has also seen a 10 per cent improvement in
measurable provider quality.
